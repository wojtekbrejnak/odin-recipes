    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie crust: Use a store-bought pastry crust or use our top-rated Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A little less than one cup of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Spices: This Libby's pumpkin pie recipe is perfectly spiced with cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.</li>
            <li>Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, adding complexity. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li>Eggs: Two eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the pumpkin pie filling together.</li>
            <li>Pumpkin: Of course, you'll need a can of Libby's pure pumpkin.</li>
            <li>Evaporated milk: A can of evaporated milk lends richness and helps thicken the pie filling.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the spices in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Stir in the pumpkin and spices, then pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie for about 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the heat and bake until a knife comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
