    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This best pumpkin pie recipe came about after many years of experimentation. I've finally perfected what I think is the ideal formula for a rich pumpkin pie that's much less likely to crack on top. Serve garnished with whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 9-inch unbaked pie crust (see footnote for recipe link)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together pumpkin, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust; crimp edges.</li>
            <li>Pour filling into crust; lightly tap on the counter to release air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the edge, should come out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
