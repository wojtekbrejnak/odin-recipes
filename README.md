# About
Welcome to my first small website created exclusively using HTML. 

Please forgive the '90 vibe, but this is a `Foundations Course` learning path project which is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

The goal of this project was to learn fundamentals of HTML and basics of git commands and git/github workflow.

___I  really feel that this small project has laid a solid foundations for my further learning.___
